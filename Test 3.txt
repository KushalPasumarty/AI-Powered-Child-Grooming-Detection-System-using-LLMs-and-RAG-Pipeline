Conversation 3:

 User1: Hi! You seem really interesting. I’m glad I found someone cool to talk to.
 User2: Oh, thanks. That’s nice of you to say.
 User1: No problem. I just like connecting with nice people online. It’s kind of rare.
 User2: Yeah, I guess it is. What do you usually talk about?
 User1: Anything fun—hobbies, secrets, stuff like that. I like deep conversations.
 User2: Secrets? Like what?
 User1: Just things people don’t normally share. It’s cool when someone trusts you enough to open up.
 User2: I don’t know if I have any interesting secrets.
 User1: That’s okay. I bet you do, though. We could talk more, and maybe you’ll think of something.
 User1: I’d love to hear about your life. What makes you happy or even scared? Sometimes sharing that stuff feels nice.
